# Outreachy Contributions 2023
Welcome to NumFOCUS!
We are excited that you are interested in contributing to our project.

Our project focuses on Open Source Governance Models.

## Definition of a Governance Model:  

In open-source software projects, the rules and customs that define who gets to do what, how they are supposed to do it and when is called a projectâ€™s "governance model." Understanding a project's governance model can help you make a successful, positive contribution to a project.

## Contribution Tasks:
1. Email our mentor, Arliss Collins, at arliss@numfocus.org and introduce yourself.  Arliss will send you the link to an open source project in her Welcome email.
2. Take a look at your assigned project to get an understanding of what they do, where and how they engage with community and how a someone can contribute to the project etc.
3. Locate the project's governance model.  Some projects have it on their websites, some have it on their main repo.
4. Review the governance model to get an understanding of the ways the project governs itself ie. leadership structure, decision making procedures etc.
5. When you're ready, [create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/numfocus/outreachy-contributions-2023/issues).
6. Add an appropriate label from those available.
