# Outreachy Contributions 2023
Welcome to NumFOCUS!
We are excited that you are interested in contributing to our project.

Our project focuses on Open Source Governance Models.

## Definition of a Governance Model:  

In open-source software projects, the rules and customs that define who gets to do what, how they are supposed to do it and when is called a projectâ€™s "governance model." Understanding a project's governance model can help you make a successful, positive contribution to a project.

Another definition ... project governance is the set of rules, procedures and policies that determine how projects are managed and overseen. These rules and procedures define how decisions are made during projects. As part of the oversight process, project governance also determines the metrics by which project success is measured.

## Contribution Tasks:

## Contrbution Task 1:
1. Email our mentor, Arliss Collins, at arliss@numfocus.org and introduce yourself.  Arliss will send you the link to an open source project in her Welcome email.
2. Take a look at your assigned project to get an understanding of what they do, where and how they engage with community and how a someone can contribute to the project etc.
3. Locate the project's governance model.  Some projects have it on their websites, some have it on their main repo.
4. Review the governance model to get an understanding of the ways the project governs itself ie. leadership structure, decision making procedures etc.
5. When you're ready, [create an issue in this repository](https://github.com/numfocus/outreachy-contributions-2023/issues).
6. Add the following to your issue:
     - Your name
     - The project you were assigned
     - Link(s) to the project governance model

          - the governance model
          - any project roles (just the names are fine)
          - the decision-making process ie. voting procedures, approval process etc.
